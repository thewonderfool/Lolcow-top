And if they will ghost you, then why not speak on it on Youtube.</p><p>I first liked Shane and Liana but now I just think it's weird. I'm not saying Kristina has no fault but it's so strange that people pick sides that easily based on the information they're getting. I remember Shane and Liana talking big about respect, doing videos about not dressing inappropriate because they value family, whole time they have sex tapes on the internet for money. It just comes to show that a lot of people just change when they get in the public eye.</p><p>And ALSO. In the videos they bashed Kristina for being single and being 35. Or even Crystal and Ray for being where they are still because of 'how they act'. What do you mean? Since when is bashing someone based on their relationshipstatus or wealth normal? Shane and Liana should humble themselves.</p></div><br><span><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ic4hm1/youtubers_shane_and_liana_actually_have_sextapes/>[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ic4hm1/youtubers_shane_and_liana_actually_have_sextapes/>[comments]</a></span><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ic4hm1/youtubers_shane_and_liana_actually_have_sextapes/>Read more</a></p></div></article></main><footer><hr><p><small>2025 &copy;</small></p><p><small><a href=https://gitlab.com/gabmus/hugo-ficurinia>Ficurinia theme</a> for <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> by <a href=https://gabmus.org>Gabriele Musco</a>.
