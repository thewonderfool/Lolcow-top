Anyways, I wanted to talk about everything that I personally know so people who don't know, can decide whether or not they still want to support him</p><p>First of all, yes, his name is not Tyler, and his sisters name is not Grace. I won't be disclosing their names and surname for the safety of their Family, but just know that was the first lie and honestly kind of a weird one.</p><p>The next thing is what blew everything up. Haley Sharpe (a tiktok and instagram influencer) came out with a tiktok on her "secret" account @postysdaughter saying "getting cheated on but feeling like I've been let into a club of all the other girls he's done this to" with the hashtag #hansumfella in the caption. "Tyler" never actually disclosed that he was in a relationship AT ALL to his fan base, and it was later found out that another girl he cheated on was (@rissy5791 on tiktok) and in her most recent post, you can see them together. (Update: it was deleted but it said something like "I'm not embarrassed to make him wear this" and it was just some dumb video of them dancing)</p><p>I cannot find Rissys age disclosed anywhere But there was a video of Haley deliberately saying that he cheated on her with a 19 year old. I'm unsure if this was a tiktok and deleted or if it was an intagram story. I don't think anyone really knows who this 19 year old is, and until there's more solid proof I won't make any assumptions.</p><p>There was also another situation about 5 months ago where another one of his exes came onto tiktok saying something about him cheating (she deleted the video very quickly apparently and I never saw it but her account is @tiierralisaan) Then "Tyler" then went onto Twitch to address the allegations and said “we were on and off a lot in that relationship and there was some miscommunication about where we were at, in the relationship at that time period.” He then denies making secret accounts and says this thing between him and his ex was settled a long time ago.</p><p>Unsure if this is also proven to be him, but someone on the hansumfella discord found a tinder account a few weeks ago, with his photo, and it's notable to mention that this photo was never posted on any of his known accounts, so it's somewhat unlikely that this is a fake account.</p><p>I also want to add that in Haley's video she deliberately said “all the other girls” implying that there's more than just one.</p><p>But in the end, believe what you want to, I'm not putting this out here to cancel him, or try to get anyone to hate him, but I do think it's something people who want to know should be able to know.</p><p>Edit: I guess the whole hansumfella subreddit is being scrubbed of any criticism since a few other posts have gone missing since earlier today</p></div>  submitted by   <a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/something_smart__>/u/something_smart__</a><br><span><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ib0sz3/hansumfella_drama/>[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ib0sz3/hansumfella_drama/>[comments]</a></span><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ib0sz3/hansumfella_drama/>Read more</a></p></div></article></main><footer><hr><p><small>2025 &copy;</small></p><p><small><a href=https://gitlab.com/gabmus/hugo-ficurinia>Ficurinia theme</a> for <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> by <a href=https://gabmus.org>Gabriele Musco</a>.
