Thats just way too many shits for 24 hours. Also the fact that they were all over her house, not in one or 2 locations where all her changing stuff is at. She would have to grab all her supplies and bring them to the kid every time rather than just bringing the kid to the station, which makes no sense if she was 'too tired'. you see no mess of baby wipes or anything alongside the diapers. This is all pointing to this being staged. which too be fair is pretty easy- just roll up 17 diapers and toss them around the house and then pretend to find them.</p> <p>now this being said, even if all her antics are staged for rage bait, I don't think that necessarily makes it <em>not</em> abusive cause the kids can't tell the difference in the reasoning for her behaviour, but it just makes it abusive in a different way i guess.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ASSbestoslover666"> /u/ASSbestoslover666 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1hf9kn1/17_diapers_mom_is_it_all_staged/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1hf9kn1/17_diapers_mom_is_it_all_staged/">[comments]</a></span>

I am not understanding how Bri is getting so much hate. If my best friend sat aside while the internet trashed me for months I wouldn't want to do the podcast with her anymore either. Everyone keeps bringing ZB up as if that's why Grace was taking a step back from the friendship but ZB had nothing to do with any of the hate Bri was getting for the past year. Every single thing Bri said during the podcasts would get spun around. The fact that Grace knew Bri was in an abusive relationship and still chose not to stand up for her against the hate just shows me what an absolute terrible friend she actually was. Youre telling me Grace was so concerned about how ZB was treating her &quot;best friend&quot; but she was totally fine with how the internet was treating her? Grace didnt care at all about Bri the minute she realized she didnt need her. My opinion is that Grace has always been jealous of Bri and the minute the internet started building her up she was loving it. There is no way in hell Grace didn't know the insane amount of hate Bri would get when she made that Instagram post. Now she's making jokes about it at her shows but when Bri decided to explain her side of things on the podcast she gets even more hate? In what world does that make sense to anyone? If I became famous and brought you along for the ride and gave you a platform to build your career and all I ask in return is that you stand up for me in the public eye I don't think I'm asking for much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Least_likely1"> /u/Least_likely1 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1hebeqh/bri_and_grace_drama/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1hebeqh/bri_and_grace_drama/">[comments]</a></span>

Anyways, I wanted to talk about everything that I personally know so people who don't know, can decide whether or not they still want to support him</p> <p>First of all, yes, his name is not Tyler, and his sisters name is not Grace. I won't be disclosing their names and surname for the safety of their Family, but just know that was the first lie and honestly kind of a weird one.</p> <p>The next thing is what blew everything up. Haley Sharpe (a tiktok and instagram influencer) came out with a tiktok on her &quot;secret&quot; account @postysdaughter saying &quot;getting cheated on but feeling like I've been let into a club of all the other girls he's done this to&quot; with the hashtag #hansumfella in the caption. &quot;Tyler&quot; never actually disclosed that he was in a relationship AT ALL to his fan base, and it was later found out that another girl he cheated on was (@rissy5791 on tiktok) and in her most recent post, you can see them together. (Update: it was deleted but it said something like &quot;I'm not embarrassed to make him wear this&quot; and it was just some dumb video of them dancing) </p> <p>I cannot find Rissys age disclosed anywhere But there was a video of Haley deliberately saying that he cheated on her with a 19 year old. I'm unsure if this was a tiktok and deleted or if it was an intagram story. I don't think anyone really knows who this 19 year old is, and until there's more solid proof I won't make any assumptions.</p> <p>There was also another situation about 5 months ago where another one of his exes came onto tiktok saying something about him cheating (she deleted the video very quickly apparently and I never saw it but her account is @tiierralisaan) Then &quot;Tyler&quot; then went onto Twitch to address the allegations and said “we were on and off a lot in that relationship and there was some miscommunication about where we were at, in the relationship at that time period.” He then denies making secret accounts and says this thing between him and his ex was settled a long time ago. </p> <p>Unsure if this is also proven to be him, but someone on the hansumfella discord found a tinder account a few weeks ago, with his photo, and it's notable to mention that this photo was never posted on any of his known accounts, so it's somewhat unlikely that this is a fake account. </p> <p>I also want to add that in Haley's video she deliberately said “all the other girls” implying that there's more than just one. </p> <p>But in the end, believe what you want to, I'm not putting this out here to cancel him, or try to get anyone to hate him, but I do think it's something people who want to know should be able to know. </p> <p>Edit: I guess the whole hansumfella subreddit is being scrubbed of any criticism since a few other posts have gone missing since earlier today</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/something_smart__"> /u/something_smart__ </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ib0sz3/hansumfella_drama/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ib0sz3/hansumfella_drama/">[comments]</a></span>

Today, we’re navigating a stormy sea of controversy, steering our ship through the murky waters of moral outrage and public condemnation. I’ve produced countless videos over the years, each a labor of love or a duty reluctantly undertaken. This one, however, occupies a treacherous middle ground. I’m compelled to make it because I believe my perspective on the Chris Savino controversy is not only necessary but a torch in the darkness of a one-sided narrative. Yet, whenever I’ve dared to voice these thoughts on this issue online, I’ve noticed strong reactions and pushback from those who feel passionately about the topic. </p> <p> </p> <p>To start, the story of Chris Savino's sexual harassment allegations reminded me of a very obscure, historical figure from the early 1900s: a sailor named Fred 'Anchor' Williams. He earned the nickname because he was the first man, at a young age, to make an anchor all by himself. </p> <p> </p> <p>Williams was an opportunistic sailor who saw the societal shifts of the 1920s as a chance to capitalize on the uptick in women's rights movements. Recognizing the potential for profit and novelty, he assembled an all-female crew, marketing them as a groundbreaking salvage team capable of handling the toughest jobs on the high seas. While publicly, Williams championed the progressive idea of women in maritime roles, privately, he maintained a harsh and tyrannical hold over his crew, exploiting their vulnerabilities and enforcing strict discipline through fear and abuse. </p> <p> </p> <p>But fate, as it often does, had its own plans. In the sweltering heat of July 1928, Sarah, the ship's navigator, fired a bullet into Williams with his own gun. She accused him of heinous abuses, but her cries echoed in the void of disbelief. Lacking evidence, society dismissed her claims as the mad ramblings of a disgruntled woman. Decades later, in the 1990s, the truth surfaced from the depths—Williams’ journal, his own damning words, buried in the bowels of his ship </p> <p> </p> <p>'Today was another scorching day on the open sea, and tempers were high. I found Sarah, dawdling near the bow when she should have been charting our course. I grabbed her by the arm and dragged her to the captain’s quarters, where I made it clear that disobedience would not be tolerated. I struck her across the face and locked her in the small storage room without food or water for the remainder of the day. The other women whispered among themselves, but I reminded them that any sign of insubordination would be met with the same fate. These women need to understand their place aboard this ship. Discipline must be maintained at all costs.' </p> <p> </p> <p>Honestly, I can't believe anyone would write that in a journal. 'Dear Diary, today I definitely didn’t rob that bank—wink wink' </p> <p> </p> <p>Joking aside, why do I bring up this obscure piece of history, you may ask? Well, if you know the Chris Savino drama, you know that he was accused by 11 different women of sexually harassing them, with the allegations coming out in an article from Cartoon Brew. After that, Nickelodeon suspended Chris, and after a two-week investigation by the Animation Guild, he was fired. </p> <p> </p> <p>Here’s where my skepticism takes the helm: The initial article from Cartoon Brew gave voice to the accusers, but provided no concrete evidence, no response from Savino, nothing but shadows and whispers. Nickelodeon's actions? Equally murky. They suspended him, investigated, then fired him—without any public explanation of what evidence, if any, they found. What transformed their caution into conviction? What truth did they uncover? If they truly had nothing to hide, then speaking out would only shine a light on their shadows. This lack of transparency raises questions, but without specific information, it’s difficult to logically reach any conclusions, unless it's that Chris Savino is some Saturday morning villain, rather than a human like the rest of us. Now, I understand that without specific knowledge from Nickelodeon, it makes it hard to think they did a bad job, but it also is just as hard to say they did a good one too. It’s like when your friend tells you they’ve got dirt on you, but instead of showing them to you, they just give you vague hints and ask you to trust them. Yeah, I’m gonna need to see those receipts. I know, using a friend's 'receipts' as a comparison might seem a bit flimsy, but it's a way to express how frustrating it is when evidence isn’t shared. </p> <p> </p> <p>The second most important issue here is the Animation Guild's poor handling of the situation. Savino claims that during his hearing with the Animation Guild, he was not given the opportunity to speak. While there is no direct evidence to support this claim, it’s important to note that the process was managed by a union, not a legal court. Given potential biases that can occur in such settings, it raises questions about whether the procedure was entirely impartial </p> <p> </p> <p>I guess the reason I'm so passionate about this, is because of a situation from my own past, where I felt the sting of false accusations and the absence of due process. Back in middle school, we used to write weekly affirmations to each other on sticky notes. One day, a teacher pulled me aside, accusing me of writing something inappropriate to a girl—a note that said, 'Tell your friend she's hot.' I hadn't written it, and when I showed my handwriting to prove it, it was clear that I didn’t write the note. Yet, despite the evidence, the teacher still lectured me as if I were guilty, saying, 'Let’s say this was you…' </p> <p> </p> <p>That was just the first of many false allegations I had, one actually took me a whole year to mentally recover from. Even though none of the things I went through were anywhere near the scale of the Savino case, the experience stuck with me. Being falsely accused and having to defend yourself against something you didn’t do—while those in authority still treat you as guilty—feels like a complete violation of fairness. The process matters. Without it, even the innocent can be punished unjustly, and that’s what I see happening in cases like Chris Savino’s. </p> <p> </p> <p>When guilds, organizations, or mobs can bypass the judicial process, wielding unchecked power, it's high time we question their authority. Should they hold the power to destroy a man’s livelihood without transparent, fair procedures? The public, too, bears the mark of this madness, so quick to rally behind the cry of the victim that any dissent, any whisper of caution or call for evidence, is branded as evil, almost like a cult </p> <p> </p> <p>Take, for example, the case of Harvey Weinstein. He was brought to court over seven counts of sexual misconduct, but only convicted on three. The legal process was critical—not to excuse his abhorrent behavior—but to ensure that each accusation was examined properly. Thanks to the court, we learned that while Weinstein’s actions were undoubtedly criminal, they weren’t as extensive as initially reported. This highlights the importance of a fair and transparent investigation. Without it, we leave room for overinflation of guilt, or worse, potential innocence being swept aside in the tide of public opinion. </p> <p> </p> <p>We're so united by the idea that society is so messed, and we're so angry at people who mess it up, that we forget that even they are human, just like us. Chris has bipolar disorder, which, while it doesn’t excuse any harmful actions, suggests that his behavior might not have been intentionally malicious. This raises the question of whether he deserves a chance to rehabilitate rather than be permanently vilified. Mental health issues are not an excuse for harmful behavior, and I’m not suggesting they should be. However, understanding the full context of someone’s actions can be important in determining the appropriate response. Mental health challenges should be considered in discussions about rehabilitation and accountability, even if they don’t negate responsibility. </p> <p> </p> <p>But in today’s culture, suggesting objectivity feels like committing a cardinal sin. People are so quick to dismiss this nuanced view, I wouldn't be surprised if I'm labeled a &quot;rape apologist&quot; simply for advocating for evidence and due process. </p> <p> </p> <p>Blind belief is the archnemesis of truth. When we accept every accusation without scrutiny, we open the door to manipulation, to the lies that masquerade as justice. We must recognize the gravity of sexual harassment allegations, yet we must also defend due process, demand evidence, and insist on transparency. Otherwise, we risk becoming pawns in a game of deception, either condemning the innocent or failing the real victims who need our support. </p> <p> </p> <p>For example, here's a plot twist: everything I told you about Fred 'Anchor' Williams was a lie. I just took some old pictures from the early 1900s, generated some with AI, and had ChatGPT help me craft the story. </p> <p> </p> <p>Some of you probably believed me; And to those of you who Googled it mid-video—hey, I respect the hustle. You’re the true fact-checkers, and the ones social media truly needs! But regardless what you did, that, my vigilant viewers, is the essence of my message. I can't stress enough, that this twist is a device to illustrate how easily misinformation can spread and how crucial it is to demand proof. </p> <p> </p> <p>Need a real life example? Here's one: The Salem Witch Trials, which are a stark reminder of what happens when fear overtakes reason, and accusations are accepted without scrutiny. People’s lives were destroyed because of rumors, hysteria, and a lack of fair process. Are we repeating the same mistakes today? </p> <p> </p> <p>The Salem Witch Trials are taught in history classes not just as a series of tragic events but as a lesson in the dangers of mob mentality and the absence of due process. Today, we must be vigilant to ensure that we do not let history repeat itself, even in more modern contexts. Justice demands fairness, transparency, and evidence, whether in 1692 or 2024 </p> <p> </p> <p>I’m not defending Savino or excusing any possible harmful behavior. I believe allegations of sexual harassment should be taken seriously. However, taking them seriously means following a fair and transparent process. This is about safeguarding everyone’s rights and ensuring justice is served in a manner that is beyond reproach. </p> <p> </p> <p>I believe that victims’ voices should be heard and that their allegations should be investigated thoroughly. However, listening to victims doesn’t mean we should abandon due process. True justice requires that we carefully examine all evidence, protect the rights of both accusers and the accused, and ensure a fair trial or investigation </p> <p> </p> <p>My aim with this video, is not to undermine any specific investigation but to highlight the importance of transparency. When organizations act without making their evidence or processes clear, it opens the door to skepticism and doubt. Asking for transparency is not an attack on the accusers or investigators—it’s a call to uphold the highest standards of justice. </p> <p> </p> <p>The language I’ve used today is meant to convey the seriousness of these issues. When someone’s career and reputation are at stake, and when victims’ claims are involved, it is a serious matter. The historical analogy is not meant to trivialize the situation but to illustrate the importance of truth and the dangers of acting without evidence. </p> <p> </p> <p>Ultimately, my goal with this video is not to undermine anyone but to emphasize the importance of a fair, transparent process in these situations. Accusations should always be taken seriously, but they must also be handled in a way that ensures justice for all parties involved. Asking for clarity and evidence is not about doubting the accusers—it's about ensuring the highest standards of fairness and justice are upheld. </p> <p> </p> <p>And to those who wish to drown this message in a sea of dislikes and angry comments, remember: you were warned. The thumbnail promised you might be triggered, yet you clicked anyway. But hey, I’m ready—I've got a floatie and a towel for all that incoming splashback. Maybe some popcorn too, because I love a good show. Stay informed, stay skeptical, and above all, stay vigilant! </p> <p> TL;DR: Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance, as Einstein wisely said, and this sentiment underscores the importance of due process and transparency in controversies like the Chris Savino case. Accused of sexual harassment by 11 women and swiftly fired after an internal investigation, Savino's case raises questions about the lack of evidence shared, the impartiality of union hearings, and the broader societal tendency to rush to judgment without scrutiny. While accountability for harmful actions is essential, blind belief risks unjustly punishing the innocent and failing genuine victims. Balancing justice with objectivity and fair procedures is critical to ensuring truth prevails in the court of public opinion.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HDhunter360"> /u/HDhunter360 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ia1jq2/hey_friends_i_wrote_this_script_for_a_youtube/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ia1jq2/hey_friends_i_wrote_this_script_for_a_youtube/">[comments]</a></span>

Until she met let’s call him jack. She met him on one of her tinder binges he was a nice guy but I never grew close. And then my stepsister came along and then I was overlooked. She was obviously the favorite getting spoiled rotten when I got her old stuff. Fast forward a couple years Im now 22 leading to the part where our relationship broke. Our parents would throw a big party one a year and while they were on the stage talking my stepsister poured wine on me. She is 20. I don’t even know why she had it. So I kicked her down and there was a brawl and they had to separate us. And guess who got in trouble ME while she got off with a slap on the wrist. A while after I got a bf my bf was a good guy. And my single stepsister couldn’t handle her being single and me being together. So she forged som pics and accused me of cheating. And we broke up. It was painfull but I couldn’t take it so one month later I planted drugs in her house and now she in jail for 20 years and got charged with battery on a law inforcement officer and criminal drug use and smuggling and I sue her for emotionally abusing me. So am I the asshole for getting my spoiled stepsister in jail?

It's essentially for that reason alone it should be banned. Your crying over an app, why not go outside and live a real life. The sad crying dramatic videos is just amusing to watch. Honestly I think this is all a ploy for the new president to reinstate it so young people see him as there saviour and they vote for his party more... smart move! I've never had tiktok I found it lame!! So I won't miss a thing . </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Global_Look_2814"> /u/Global_Look_2814 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1i54nca/tiktok_drama/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1i54nca/tiktok_drama/">[comments]</a></span>

He got the best of me. I decided to search for it to see if they were real, and I stumbled across a Russian video and I checked the comments in those full bots promoting their telegram channels. At first I thought they were just trolls or just lead me to a website telling me I got trolled, but oh no no it was way worse worse. I found CP and I immediately deleted the chat and blocked these bots. I was beyond disgusted and the fact that this was on an app that had minor as well and people who do even want to be around this stuff is crazy. It was just out there public knowledge. It wasn't even on the deep web. TikTok is getting banned soon, but there is problems like this in all social media with bots and people just trying to spread illegal content. I hope social media will bring a new system which will not allow this to be spread around and I hope this message will spread around and help stop these.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zealousideal-Clue330"> /u/Zealousideal-Clue330 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1hphilk/tiktok_used_to_have_and_probably_still_does_have/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1hphilk/tiktok_used_to_have_and_probably_still_does_have/">[comments]</a></span>

Just Google 'Shane Liana sextapes' and go to images or even 'Shane Liana Onlyfans'.</p> <p>They trashed Kristina but I believe there are two sides of the story. In the last videos they did with the 'receipts' you see that Liana actually lashed out saying 'how dare you..' through text. She wasn't nice about it all. Also, they didn't invite Crystal and Ray over suddenly. I think it's weird that everyone just dismisses that part. If you were friends with someone and then they suddenly ghost you, then you would be mad about it as well and make a video on it and speaking your truth, because that hurts. There is no point in talking about it behind the public if you are ghosted suddenly anyway. I also remember where Liana in a video said that no one helped them move without saying names in the video, that's just shady. The fact that Shane and Liana just try to cover it up by saying 'we just distanced ourselves because of a rotten apple' and not only distanced themselves from Kristina (the rotten apple) but also suddenly from 2 of their other friends, I understand that that just doesn't sit right. And if they will ghost you, then why not speak on it on Youtube.</p> <p>I first liked Shane and Liana but now I just think it's weird. I'm not saying Kristina has no fault but it's so strange that people pick sides that easily based on the information they're getting. I remember Shane and Liana talking big about respect, doing videos about not dressing inappropriate because they value family, whole time they have sex tapes on the internet for money. It just comes to show that a lot of people just change when they get in the public eye.</p> <p>And ALSO. In the videos they bashed Kristina for being single and being 35. Or even Crystal and Ray for being where they are still because of 'how they act'. What do you mean? Since when is bashing someone based on their relationshipstatus or wealth normal? Shane and Liana should humble themselves.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ic4hm1/youtubers_shane_and_liana_actually_have_sextapes/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ic4hm1/youtubers_shane_and_liana_actually_have_sextapes/">[comments]</a></span>
