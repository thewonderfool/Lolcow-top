Thats just way too many shits for 24 hours. Also the fact that they were all over her house, not in one or 2 locations where all her changing stuff is at. She would have to grab all her supplies and bring them to the kid every time rather than just bringing the kid to the station, which makes no sense if she was 'too tired'. you see no mess of baby wipes or anything alongside the diapers. This is all pointing to this being staged. which too be fair is pretty easy- just roll up 17 diapers and toss them around the house and then pretend to find them.</p></p><p><a href=https://lolcow.top/posts/2025-02-04-17-diapers-mom--is-it-all-staged/>Continue reading </a></p></div></div><hr></article><article class="card postlistitem"><div><h2><a href=https://lolcow.top/posts/2025-02-04-andrew-shulz-x-jack-schlossberg/>andrew shulz x jack schlossberg</a></h2><p class=date><span title=Date>󰃭 </span>2025-02-04</p><div class=articlePreview><p><div class=md><p>what did andrew shulz say/do that jack schossberg wants to debate him so bad. whats the beef i dont get it:</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFVQhkkRZSh/?igsh=MW4ydjF4YTRxOTU5OA%3D%3D">https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFVQhkkRZSh/?igsh=MW4ydjF4YTRxOTU5OA%3D%3D</a></p><p>and</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFVIigXRg-O/?igsh=cHpiMXdlOXc0Y2d1">https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFVIigXRg-O/?igsh=cHpiMXdlOXc0Y2d1</a></p></div>  submitted by   <a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/WeatherCertain7763>/u/WeatherCertain7763</a><br><span><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ibcvb6/andrew_shulz_x_jack_schlossberg/>[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ibcvb6/andrew_shulz_x_jack_schlossberg/>[comments]</a></span><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1ibcvb6/andrew_shulz_x_jack_schlossberg/>Read more</a></p></p><p><a href=https://lolcow.top/posts/2025-02-04-andrew-shulz-x-jack-schlossberg/>Continue reading </a></p></div></div><hr></article><article class="card postlistitem"><div><h2><a href=https://lolcow.top/posts/2025-02-04-bri-and-grace-drama/>Bri and Grace drama</a></h2><p class=date><span title=Date>󰃭 </span>2025-02-04</p><div class=articlePreview><p><div class=md><p>Unpopular opinion apparently but Grace is not the victim. I am not understanding how Bri is getting so much hate. If my best friend sat aside while the internet trashed me for months I wouldn't want to do the podcast with her anymore either. Everyone keeps bringing ZB up as if that's why Grace was taking a step back from the friendship but ZB had nothing to do with any of the hate Bri was getting for the past year. Every single thing Bri said during the podcasts would get spun around. The fact that Grace knew Bri was in an abusive relationship and still chose not to stand up for her against the hate just shows me what an absolute terrible friend she actually was. Youre telling me Grace was so concerned about how ZB was treating her "best friend" but she was totally fine with how the internet was treating her? Grace didnt care at all about Bri the minute she realized she didnt need her. My opinion is that Grace has always been jealous of Bri and the minute the internet started building her up she was loving it. There is no way in hell Grace didn't know the insane amount of hate Bri would get when she made that Instagram post. Now she's making jokes about it at her shows but when Bri decided to explain her side of things on the podcast she gets even more hate? In what world does that make sense to anyone? If I became famous and brought you along for the ride and gave you a platform to build your career and all I ask in return is that you stand up for me in the public eye I don't think I'm asking for much.</p></p><p><a href=https://lolcow.top/posts/2025-02-04-bri-and-grace-drama/>Continue reading </a></p></div></div><hr></article><article class="card postlistitem"><div><h2><a href=https://lolcow.top/posts/2025-02-04-cyrus-family-drama/>Cyrus family drama?</a></h2><p class=date><span title=Date>󰃭 </span>2025-02-04</p><div class=articlePreview><p><div class=md><p>What's this issue where Miley Cyrus and Noah Cyrus are hating on their dad right now it seems like there's some Cyrus family drama and I'm not sure what caused it or what's going on does anybody know?
