(update: it was deleted but it said something like \u0026quot;i'm not embarrassed to make him wear this\u0026quot; and it was just some dumb video of them dancing) i cannot find rissys age disclosed anywhere but there was a video of haley deliberately saying that he cheated on her with a 19 year old. i'm unsure if this was a tiktok and deleted or if it was an intagram story. i don't think anyone really knows who this 19 year old is, and until there's more solid proof i won't make any assumptions.\nthere was also another situation about 5 months ago where another one of his exes came onto tiktok saying something about him cheating (she deleted the video very quickly apparently and i never saw it but her account is @tiierralisaan) then \u0026quot;tyler\u0026quot; then went onto twitch to address the allegations and said “we were on and off a lot in that relationship and there was some miscommunication about where we were at, in the relationship at that time period.” he then denies making secret accounts and says this thing between him and his ex was settled a long time ago. unsure if this is also proven to be him, but someone on the hansumfella discord found a tinder account a few weeks ago, with his photo, and it's notable to mention that this photo was never posted on any of his known accounts, so it's somewhat unlikely that this is a fake account. i also want to add that in haley's video she deliberately said “all the other girls” implying that there's more than just one. but in the end, believe what you want to, i'm not putting this out here to cancel him, or try to get anyone to hate him, but i do think it's something people who want to know should be able to know. edit: i guess the whole hansumfella subreddit is being scrubbed of any criticism since a few other posts have gone missing since earlier today\n\u0026#32; submitted by \u0026#32; /u/something_smart__ [link] \u0026#32; [comments] read more\n","title":"Hansumfella drama"},{"date":"2025-02-04","image":"","imageAlt":"","link":"https://lolcow.top/posts/2025-02-04-hey-friends-i-wrote-this-script-for-a-youtube-video-about-chris-savino-and-would-love-to-start-a-conversationtldr-at-the-bottom/","summary":"\u003c!-- SC_OFF --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"md\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026quot;Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.\u0026quot; – Albert Einstein \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGood evening, vigilant viewers.

'dear diary, today i definitely didn’t rob that bank—wink wink' joking aside, why do i bring up this obscure piece of history, you may ask? well, if you know the chris savino drama, you know that he was accused by 11 different women of sexually harassing them, with the allegations coming out in an article from cartoon brew. after that, nickelodeon suspended chris, and after a two-week investigation by the animation guild, he was fired. here’s where my skepticism takes the helm: the initial article from cartoon brew gave voice to the accusers, but provided no concrete evidence, no response from savino, nothing but shadows and whispers. nickelodeon's actions? equally murky. they suspended him, investigated, then fired him—without any public explanation of what evidence, if any, they found. what transformed their caution into conviction? what truth did they uncover? if they truly had nothing to hide, then speaking out would only shine a light on their shadows. this lack of transparency raises questions, but without specific information, it’s difficult to logically reach any conclusions, unless it's that chris savino is some saturday morning villain, rather than a human like the rest of us. now, i understand that without specific knowledge from nickelodeon, it makes it hard to think they did a bad job, but it also is just as hard to say they did a good one too. it’s like when your friend tells you they’ve got dirt on you, but instead of showing them to you, they just give you vague hints and ask you to trust them. yeah, i’m gonna need to see those receipts. i know, using a friend's 'receipts' as a comparison might seem a bit flimsy, but it's a way to express how frustrating it is when evidence isn’t shared. the second most important issue here is the animation guild's poor handling of the situation. savino claims that during his hearing with the animation guild, he was not given the opportunity to speak. while there is no direct evidence to support this claim, it’s important to note that the process was managed by a union, not a legal court. given potential biases that can occur in such settings, it raises questions about whether the procedure was entirely impartial i guess the reason i'm so passionate about this, is because of a situation from my own past, where i felt the sting of false accusations and the absence of due process. back in middle school, we used to write weekly affirmations to each other on sticky notes. one day, a teacher pulled me aside, accusing me of writing something inappropriate to a girl—a note that said, 'tell your friend she's hot.' i hadn't written it, and when i showed my handwriting to prove it, it was clear that i didn’t write the note. yet, despite the evidence, the teacher still lectured me as if i were guilty, saying, 'let’s say this was you…' that was just the first of many false allegations i had, one actually took me a whole year to mentally recover from. even though none of the things i went through were anywhere near the scale of the savino case, the experience stuck with me. being falsely accused and having to defend yourself against something you didn’t do—while those in authority still treat you as guilty—feels like a complete violation of fairness. the process matters. without it, even the innocent can be punished unjustly, and that’s what i see happening in cases like chris savino’s. when guilds, organizations, or mobs can bypass the judicial process, wielding unchecked power, it's high time we question their authority. should they hold the power to destroy a man’s livelihood without transparent, fair procedures? the public, too, bears the mark of this madness, so quick to rally behind the cry of the victim that any dissent, any whisper of caution or call for evidence, is branded as evil, almost like a cult take, for example, the case of harvey weinstein. he was brought to court over seven counts of sexual misconduct, but only convicted on three. the legal process was critical—not to excuse his abhorrent behavior—but to ensure that each accusation was examined properly. thanks to the court, we learned that while weinstein’s actions were undoubtedly criminal, they weren’t as extensive as initially reported. this highlights the importance of a fair and transparent investigation. without it, we leave room for overinflation of guilt, or worse, potential innocence being swept aside in the tide of public opinion. we're so united by the idea that society is so messed, and we're so angry at people who mess it up, that we forget that even they are human, just like us. chris has bipolar disorder, which, while it doesn’t excuse any harmful actions, suggests that his behavior might not have been intentionally malicious. this raises the question of whether he deserves a chance to rehabilitate rather than be permanently vilified. mental health issues are not an excuse for harmful behavior, and i’m not suggesting they should be. however, understanding the full context of someone’s actions can be important in determining the appropriate response. mental health challenges should be considered in discussions about rehabilitation and accountability, even if they don’t negate responsibility. but in today’s culture, suggesting objectivity feels like committing a cardinal sin. people are so quick to dismiss this nuanced view, i wouldn't be surprised if i'm labeled a \u0026quot;rape apologist\u0026quot; simply for advocating for evidence and due process. blind belief is the archnemesis of truth. when we accept every accusation without scrutiny, we open the door to manipulation, to the lies that masquerade as justice. we must recognize the gravity of sexual harassment allegations, yet we must also defend due process, demand evidence, and insist on transparency. otherwise, we risk becoming pawns in a game of deception, either condemning the innocent or failing the real victims who need our support. for example, here's a plot twist: everything i told you about fred 'anchor' williams was a lie. i just took some old pictures from the early 1900s, generated some with ai, and had chatgpt help me craft the story. some of you probably believed me; and to those of you who googled it mid-video—hey, i respect the hustle. you’re the true fact-checkers, and the ones social media truly needs! but regardless what you did, that, my vigilant viewers, is the essence of my message. i can't stress enough, that this twist is a device to illustrate how easily misinformation can spread and how crucial it is to demand proof. need a real life example? here's one: the salem witch trials, which are a stark reminder of what happens when fear overtakes reason, and accusations are accepted without scrutiny. people’s lives were destroyed because of rumors, hysteria, and a lack of fair process. are we repeating the same mistakes today? the salem witch trials are taught in history classes not just as a series of tragic events but as a lesson in the dangers of mob mentality and the absence of due process. today, we must be vigilant to ensure that we do not let history repeat itself, even in more modern contexts. justice demands fairness, transparency, and evidence, whether in 1692 or 2024 i’m not defending savino or excusing any possible harmful behavior. i believe allegations of sexual harassment should be taken seriously. however, taking them seriously means following a fair and transparent process. this is about safeguarding everyone’s rights and ensuring justice is served in a manner that is beyond reproach. i believe that victims’ voices should be heard and that their allegations should be investigated thoroughly. however, listening to victims doesn’t mean we should abandon due process. true justice requires that we carefully examine all evidence, protect the rights of both accusers and the accused, and ensure a fair trial or investigation my aim with this video, is not to undermine any specific investigation but to highlight the importance of transparency. when organizations act without making their evidence or processes clear, it opens the door to skepticism and doubt. asking for transparency is not an attack on the accusers or investigators—it’s a call to uphold the highest standards of justice. the language i’ve used today is meant to convey the seriousness of these issues. when someone’s career and reputation are at stake, and when victims’ claims are involved, it is a serious matter. the historical analogy is not meant to trivialize the situation but to illustrate the importance of truth and the dangers of acting without evidence. ultimately, my goal with this video is not to undermine anyone but to emphasize the importance of a fair, transparent process in these situations. accusations should always be taken seriously, but they must also be handled in a way that ensures justice for all parties involved. asking for clarity and evidence is not about doubting the accusers—it's about ensuring the highest standards of fairness and justice are upheld. and to those who wish to drown this message in a sea of dislikes and angry comments, remember: you were warned. the thumbnail promised you might be triggered, yet you clicked anyway. but hey, i’m ready—i've got a floatie and a towel for all that incoming splashback. maybe some popcorn too, because i love a good show. stay informed, stay skeptical, and above all, stay vigilant! tl;dr: condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance, as einstein wisely said, and this sentiment underscores the importance of due process and transparency in controversies like the chris savino case. accused of sexual harassment by 11 women and swiftly fired after an internal investigation, savino's case raises questions about the lack of evidence shared, the impartiality of union hearings, and the broader societal tendency to rush to judgment without scrutiny. while accountability for harmful actions is essential, blind belief risks unjustly punishing the innocent and failing genuine victims. balancing justice with objectivity and fair procedures is critical to ensuring truth prevails in the court of public opinion.\n\u0026#32; submitted by \u0026#32; /u/hdhunter360 [link] \u0026#32; [comments] read more\n","title":"Hey friends!
