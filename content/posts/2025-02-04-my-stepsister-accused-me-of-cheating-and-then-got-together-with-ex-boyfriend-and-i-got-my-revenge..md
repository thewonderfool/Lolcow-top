<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I 22-year-old female. I am pretty tall at a whopping 6 ft. Me and my stepsister have always been Close. We shared ice cream sometimes when we were five. My dad split up with my mom because of her bad habits. She obviously showed favoritism towards my own older sister but see went to college. And ever since my mom has been a hot mess lashing out and getting mad for no reason. Until she met let’s call him jack. She met him on one of her tinder binges he was a nice guy but I never grew close. And then my stepsister came along and then I was overlooked. She was obviously the favorite getting spoiled rotten when I got her old stuff. Fast forward a couple years Im now 22 leading to the part where our relationship broke. Our parents would throw a big party one a year and while they were on the stage talking my stepsister poured wine on me. She is 20. I don’t even know why she had it. So I kicked her down and there was a brawl and they had to separate us. And guess who got in trouble ME while she got off with a slap on the wrist. A while after I got a bf my bf was a good guy. And my single stepsister couldn’t handle her being single and me being together. So she forged som pics and accused me of cheating. And we broke up. It was painfull but I couldn’t take it so one month later I planted drugs in her house and now she in jail for 20 years and got charged with battery on a law inforcement officer and criminal drug use and smuggling and I sue her for emotionally abusing me. So am I the asshole for getting my spoiled stepsister in jail? Let Me know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/leshaundinglenut1"> /u/leshaundinglenut1 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1idl0d6/my_stepsister_accused_me_of_cheating_and_then_got/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1idl0d6/my_stepsister_accused_me_of_cheating_and_then_got/">[comments]</a></span>
