<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>she said that all those diapers came from 24hrs, which is already a lot for 24hrs, but then she later tells us that she doesn't change diapers for only pee, so that means that these would have had to have been 17 diapers full of shit. Thats just way too many shits for 24 hours. Also the fact that they were all over her house, not in one or 2 locations where all her changing stuff is at. She would have to grab all her supplies and bring them to the kid every time rather than just bringing the kid to the station, which makes no sense if she was 'too tired'. you see no mess of baby wipes or anything alongside the diapers. This is all pointing to this being staged. which too be fair is pretty easy- just roll up 17 diapers and toss them around the house and then pretend to find them.</p> <p>now this being said, even if all her antics are staged for rage bait, I don't think that necessarily makes it <em>not</em> abusive cause the kids can't tell the difference in the reasoning for her behaviour, but it just makes it abusive in a different way i guess.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ASSbestoslover666"> /u/ASSbestoslover666 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1hf9kn1/17_diapers_mom_is_it_all_staged/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1hf9kn1/17_diapers_mom_is_it_all_staged/">[comments]</a></span>
