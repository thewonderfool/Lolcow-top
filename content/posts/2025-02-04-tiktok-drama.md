<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I find it very amusing to see all the people curled up in bed crying over the tiktok ban. It's essentially for that reason alone it should be banned. Your crying over an app, why not go outside and live a real life. The sad crying dramatic videos is just amusing to watch. Honestly I think this is all a ploy for the new president to reinstate it so young people see him as there saviour and they vote for his party more... smart move! I've never had tiktok I found it lame!! So I won't miss a thing . </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Global_Look_2814"> /u/Global_Look_2814 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1i54nca/tiktok_drama/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1i54nca/tiktok_drama/">[comments]</a></span>
