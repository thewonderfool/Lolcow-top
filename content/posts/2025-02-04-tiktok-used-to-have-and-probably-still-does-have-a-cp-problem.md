<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Two months ago, I was scrolling TikTok and I saw a video saying that TikTok had CP and curiosity. He got the best of me. I decided to search for it to see if they were real, and I stumbled across a Russian video and I checked the comments in those full bots promoting their telegram channels. At first I thought they were just trolls or just lead me to a website telling me I got trolled, but oh no no it was way worse worse. I found CP and I immediately deleted the chat and blocked these bots. I was beyond disgusted and the fact that this was on an app that had minor as well and people who do even want to be around this stuff is crazy. It was just out there public knowledge. It wasn't even on the deep web. TikTok is getting banned soon, but there is problems like this in all social media with bots and people just trying to spread illegal content. I hope social media will bring a new system which will not allow this to be spread around and I hope this message will spread around and help stop these.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zealousideal-Clue330"> /u/Zealousideal-Clue330 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1hphilk/tiktok_used_to_have_and_probably_still_does_have/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/internetdrama/comments/1hphilk/tiktok_used_to_have_and_probably_still_does_have/">[comments]</a></span>
